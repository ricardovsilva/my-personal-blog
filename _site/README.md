# My personal blog

This repository is basically the repository of [my own personal blog](http://ricardovsilva.herokkuapp.com).
I spent one night to learn how to use [Jekyll](http://jekylrb.com) (recommended by [Jhonny Moreira](https://github.com/jhonnymoreira)). And, more and more I'm loving Ruby.

## What am I using?

- **Programming Language:** Basically Ruby to backend and some HTML, CSS and JS to frontend
- **Programming IDE:** [Cloud9](https://c9.io/), just fantastic, I'm able to develop and deploy from anywhere
- **Source Control:** As anyone can see, [GitHub](https://www.github.com/)
- **Host:** [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), I know just a little about it, but already earned my love.

## What's the point?

The point is: Learn to be able to teach. When teaching, I'll learn more. Learning more, I'll teach more. I win, who reads wins. Everybody wins, everybody happy. :)

## What's the repo status?

The blog is completely function, ugly yet, but functional. If you enver work or heard about [Jekyll](http://jekylrb.com), I recommend you to take a look at the [docs](jekyllrb.com/docs).

Feel free to fork and use this repo as your start point, if you want to.

Any doubt, suggestion or affliction? Let me know by opening a issue.
