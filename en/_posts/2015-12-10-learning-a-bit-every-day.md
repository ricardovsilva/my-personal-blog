resume:
  I'm not the best developer of the world, there's already a lot to learn and improve. But, without false modesty, I'm good, I'm much better than I imagined that I would be with only 4 years of experience. Do you want to how I get at this point?

Program, far beyond a science, is art. An art that requires a lot of hability and knowledge (combination also know as competence).

There's various ways to acquire such habilities, and is important keep in mind that will always been something new to learn (and this is the challenge that keep me constantly awake and studying until 3 AM).
Therefore, keep in mind, is needed to **develop** skills and acquire knowledge in order to be called "competent"

## Knowledge
We're living in XXI century, almost everything around us is information source, and our cellphones are pratically a source of infinity information. And, believe, that's great, but at same time very bad.
We can spend our time with frivolous whatsapp talks, seeing pictures on facebook, or even infinity scrolling 9gag. But, want you be a great programmer? So be care with that.

You need to uses better your time, construct your people, webpages and blogs network, and read them daily. Are you on subway or waiting for bus? This is the right moment to read an article (use your cellphone at your favor).
I regard the daily, and constant, information mining much more important than pay to do some course (a course can be a great start point, but no one course will let you able to jog market.

> To organize what I'll read and from where I will always receive news that are from **my** interest I use Feedly. A good RSS reader is essential.

Below, a short list of some of pages that I follow:

- [Troy Hunt](www.troyhunt.com) - A really good security specialist. His blog has a very natural language and his articles are always very enlightening. Mandatory stop for any developer.

- [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/)  - 
The Microsoft Academy has a lot of content and good videos. Was here where I really understood MVC. I really recommend Jumpstart (takes you from zero to "doing something usefull" in just a couple of hours). And if you think that MBA is related only to Microsoft technology, I recommend to watch [Python Django Junpstart](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/developing-websites-using-python-and-django-11415?l=AQdTENEJB_4004300477).

- [ADT Magazine](www.adtmag.com) - Various IT related content.  Security, databases, cloud computing, infrastructure, programming languages, etc.

- [Allan Kelly](allankelly.blogspot.co.uk) - British software engineer.  He is one of my favorites professionals. Post a lost of content about agile, software engineering and software architecting. His blog is mandatory stop for anyone who wants to know all steps related to software development. 

- [UX Magazine (em inglês)](uxmag.com) - I'm not specialist, and I'm not planning to be, in User Experience. But is always good have some knowledge about and have an overview to where market is going. 

##Hability

I only know one way to improve your habilities: practicing. So, how get skilled with a programming language or technology that you don't work day by day?

###Tutorials
There are countless good tutorials spread over Internet, a lot of they, including, doesn't require install of any application and can be totally done online.

- [TryRuby](tryruby.nl) - A really great online tutorial for those who wanting to get started with Ruby. I have my own participating in this tutorial, I translated that to Brazilian Portuguese.

- [Rails Book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)  - Has already learned Ruby and now want to learn your main web development framework? The Rails book is the most complete tutorial that I already seen. It's teach since basic Linux terminal commands, passing through Github, Heroku and, of course, a lot of Rails. Very recommended tutorial. 

###Games

- [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com) - Exercise javascript playing. Is like a RPG in which the only way to advance is writing code. It's always receiving updates.

- [Robot Game](https://robotgame.net/) - Multiplayer competitive game in wich you have an combat robot that must win battles against other combat robots from other players. And where's the programming? You don't control your robot, you program the AI from your robot using Python.

### OpenSource 
Um fato indiscutível é o fato que a todo instante nos estamos utilizando software OpenSource (este blog que você está lendo usa Jekyll, que é OpenSource), portanto, teve uma ótima idéia que vai ajudar um monte de gente? Nada mais justo do que contribuir um pouquinho com o mundo e participar da comunidade OpenSource. Você também pode contribuir ajudando a melhorar projetos que já existem. 

- [Github](www.github.com) - Maior rede social e de desenvolvedores e projetos OpenSource do mundo. É possível contribuir com projetos já existentes ou criar os seus próprios. Se você ainda não tem sua conta no Github, pare tudo o que está fazendo e vá criar sua conta agora. 

## Concluindo

Existe muito conteúdo bom e gratuito na Internet, basta estudar. Você deve ter reparado que a maioria do conteúdo é em inglês, se inglês ainda é o seu fraco, já passou da hora de aprender. Não dá para crescer neste mercado sem saber inglês, portanto, dedique um tempo dos seus estudos a isso. 

Na minha opinião, cursos são ótimos pontos de partida mas não irão lhe tornar profissional. O processo de profissionalização acontece a todo instante, a toda hora. É preciso dormir, comer e respirar programação. E, principalmente, gostar de programar.
